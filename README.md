# Internshala-Project

This project is a Web Application that helps the student to find the internship. There are two different portals for student as well as employer.

Student can find and apply to a single internship only at a time, whereas employer can post any number of internships by logging in.
# EVERY PROCESS IS BEING DONE JUST AFTER LOGGING IN, WITHOUT LOGGED-IN, ONE CANNOT POST/APPLY FOR AN INTERNSHIP
